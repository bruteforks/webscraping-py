### What's this repository all about

This repository is some sort of archive of scripts I've written/used for various websites. All of them can be used for free. There're a lot more scripts that I'll be gradually adding and editing over time.

> Not all scripts might be working due to UI/selectors change or anything else.

### Contributing 

If you would like to share your scripts with the world, it would be an honor for me to have your scripts in this repo. Simply clone this repo and create a PR âœ¨
